# What is rights retention?
 

One key development in scholarly publishing is the rise of open
access.  Making articles freely available under particular copyright
licences (such as CC-BY) is now required by UK research councils and
other funding bodies.  Journal publishers have responded to these
requirements in various ways, e.g. by offering 'gold open access'
routes, that often require payment of substantial article processing
charges (APCs).

Funders also permit 'green open access' as a route to compliance with
their rules.  This is where the author deposits their version of the
manuscript (the author accepted manuscript, AAM) into an institutional
repository or similar archive.  Many publishers have previously
allowed some form of self-archiving, but usually with constraints,
e.g. imposition of an embargo period (between 6-24 months).  These
constraints contradict funders' requirements that prohibit any embargo period.

The "rights retention strategy" has been developed by cOAlition S as a
way to allow researchers to retain rights on their scholarly writing
and thus meet the requirements of their funders.  This primer
describes how authors can retain their rights.


# Why should authors retain their rights?

The primary reason why researchers might wish to retain their rights
is simply to comply with funders' requirements.  Ignoring these
requirements could affect a researcher's chance of future funding.
This might be seen by some researchers as simple rule-following with
little benefit to themselves.  However, work that is available
open-access often tends to be more highly cited than work that is only
available behind a paywall [@Langham-Putrow2021-qf].  Open-access
licences on work also allows for rapid reuse by the community, e.g. in
books, talks, wikipedia and social media.

In many professional disciplines, the creator of the work naturally
maintains rights to their work.  Many journal publishers have
previously stated that they require exclusive rights to publish the
work.  This is simply not true [@Suber2022-dm].

# How to retain rights to your manuscripts

In theory, the process of retaining rights on your manuscripts is
simple.  Before submitting your work to a journal, add the following
phrase to your manuscript e.g. in the Acknowledgements
section:

    For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a Creative
	Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence to any Author Accepted
	Manuscript version arising from this submission.

It is also a good idea to tell the editor, in your cover letter, that
you wish to retain rights to any author-accepted manuscript resulting
from your submission.

That's it.  If your paper is accepted by the editor after peer-review,
your author accepted manuscript can then be deposited in a suitable
open repository under a CC-BY licence without embargo.  You are then
free to also share the manuscript however you choose.

## What if things go wrong?

Researchers may be sceptical that this approach may always work
without concerns.  Open access advocates have raised concerns about the
legality [@Khoo2021-tl] and longer-term implications
[@Kamerlin2020-lq] of rights retention approaches.  Whilst I
personally disagree with those concerns, there are indeed several
caveats that should be mentioned.

1. A journal editor may decline reviewing ("desk reject") your
   manuscript because it uses rights retention language.  To date, I
   am aware of only one journal publisher, the American Society of
   Hematology, that has chosen this route.  Whilst unfortunate, each
   publisher may decline to review articles for many reasons.
   However, although many traditional publishers have voiced their
   concerns about rights retention
   <https://ioppublishing.org/signatories_publish_statement_on_rights_retention_strategy/>,
   those same publishers are allowing authors to exert their natural
   rights
   <https://github.com/rossmounce/rrs-language-including-outputs>.

2. One of the largest publishers, Springer Nature, noted in April 2021
   that in some cases they will effectively ignore rights retention
   language in manuscripts
   <https://www.springernature.com/gp/advancing-discovery/blog/blogposts/continuing-the-open-access-transition/19045440>
   and require a transfer of copyright.  This will create a conflict
   once the manuscript has been editorially accepted.  Ignoring
   researcher rights on their work is highly unethical, and puts
   researchers in a very difficult position.  To avoid this stalemate,
   a researcher could seek confirmation from the editor that they can
   retain their rights before submitting their manuscript.  A simpler
   approach would be to avoid that publisher.
   
3. If you publish your work in a subscription journal, as long as you
   make your AAM freely available without embargo, you do not need to
   pay the journal an APC.  (The journal may still demand other
   charges, such as for colour figures in-print.)  However, if you
   publish your work in an open-access journal, you may still need to
   pay an APCs to have your work published.  Often these costs are
   covered by institutional arrangements with the publisher.

The route to open access is therefore often more complicated than it
need be.  If in doubt, researchers may seek local advice e.g. from
library staff, when choosing which journal to submit their work to,
and funding sources for any charges. The journal checker tool
<https://journalcheckertool.org/> provides information about journal
compliance with funders' OA policies.


## Institutional support for rights retention

Researchers can use the rights retention strategy by themselves to
comply with funders' requirements for open access.  To support their
researchers, several UK institutions have already adopted rights
retention policies that apply to their employees.  These policies
typically give the institution a non-exclusive right to archive author
accepted manuscripts.  The researcher gains an extra layer of
institutional support in the (hopefully rare) case that a publisher
raises a concern with rights retention language in the manuscript.  A
list of current institutional policies is available at:
<https://github.com/sje30/rrs/blob/main/ukinstitutions.csv> ; this
list is expected to grow considerably during 2023 and 2024.
