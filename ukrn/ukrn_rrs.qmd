# What is rights retention?

One of the key developments in scholarly publishing, particularly
within the UK over the last ten years, has been the rise of open
access publishing.  Making articles freely available under
particular copright licences (such as CC-BY) is now a requirement of
funding from most research councils and funding agencies in the UK and
beyond.  Journal publishers are now gradually responding to these
requirements in various ways, e.g. by offering 'gold open access'
routes, that often require payment of substantial article processing
charges (APCs) so that their formatted version of your paper can be
shared.  The final version, provided by the publisher is often called
the 'version of record' (VOR).

Funders also permit 'green open access' as a route to compliance with
their rules.  This is where the author deposits their version of the
manuscript (the author accepted manuscript, AAM) into an institutional
repository or similar archvie.  Many publishers have previously
allowed some form of self-archiving, but usually with constraints,
e.g. imposition of an embargo period (between 6-24 months).  These
constraints contradict the funders'requirements.

The 'rights retention strategy' has been developed by coalition S as a
way to allow researchers to retain rights on their scholarly writing
and thus meet the requirements of their funders.  This primer
describes how authors can retain their rights.


# Why should authors retain their rights?

The primary reason that researchers might wish to retain their rights
is simply to ensure they comply with requirements from their funding
bodies.  Ignoring these requirements could affect a resarcher's chance
of future funding.  This might be seen by some researchers as simple
rule-following with little benefit to themselves.  However, work that
is available open-access often tends to be more highly cited than work
that is only available behind a paywall [@Langham-Putrow2021-qf].
Open-access licences on work also allows for rapid reuse by the
community, e.g. in books, talks, wikipedia and social media.

In many creative and professional disciplines, the creator of the work
maintains rights to their work.  Journal publishers have previously
stated that they require a transfer of rights (from the researcher to
the publisher) to enable them to publish the work.  This however is
simply not true: publishers need only get a non-exclusive permission
(from the researcher) to publish the work [@Subser2022-dm].

# How to retain rights to your manuscripts

In theory, the process of retaining rights on your manuscripts is
simple.  Before submitting your work to a journal, put the following
phrase to your manuscript e.g. inthe Acknowledgements
section:

It is also a good idea to tell the editor, in your cover letter
alongside the initial submission, that you wish to retain rights to
any author-accepted manuscript resulting from your submission.

That's it.  Once your paper is accepted by the editor, your
author-accepted manuscripted can then be deposited in a suitable
archive under a CC-BY licence without embargo.  You are then free to
also share the manuscript however you choose.

## What if things go wrong?

Researchers may, rightly, be skeptical, that this approach may
universally work without concerns.  Open acess advocates have raised
concerns about the legality [@Khoo2021-tl] and longer-term
implications [@Kamerlin2020-lq] of rights retention approaches.
Whilst I personally disagree with those concerns, there are indeed
several caveats that should be mentioned.

1. A journal editor may decline reviewing your manuscript because it
   uses rights retention language.  To date, I am aware of only one
   journal publisher, ASH, that has chosen this route.  Whilst
   unfortunate, each publisher may choose not to review articles for
   any number of reasons.  However, althought many traditional
   publishers have voiced their concerns about rights retention [],
   those same publishers are allowing authors to exert their natural
   rights [see Ross list from 2021].

2. One leading publisher, Springer Nature, noted in April 2021 that in
   some cases they will ignore rights retention language in
   manuscripts [] and require a transfer of copyright.  This will 
   create a conflict once the manuscript has been
   editorially accepted.  Ignoring researcher rights on their work is
   highly unethical, and puts researchers in a very difficult
   position.  To avoid this stalemate, a researcher could seek
   confirmation from the editor that they can retain their rights
   before submitting their manuscript.  A simpler approach would be to
   avoid that publisher.
   
3. If you publish your work in a subscription journal, as long as you
   make your AAM freely available without embargo, you do not need to
   pay the journal an APC.  (The journal may still demand other
   charges, such as for colour figures in-print.)  However, if you
   publish your work in an open-acess journal, you may still need to
   pay an APCs to have your work published.  Often these costs are
   covered by institutional arrangements with the publisher.


The route to open access is therefore often more complicated than it
need be.  If in doubt, researchers may seek local advice e.g. from
library staff, when choosing which journal to submit their work to,
and funding sources for any charges. The journal checker tool
<https://journalcheckertool.org/> provides information about journal
compliance with funders' OA policies.


## Institutional support for rights retention

Researchers can use the rights retention strategy by themselves to
comply with funder's requirements for open access.  To support their
researchers, several UK institutions have already adopted rights
retention policies.  These policies typically give the institution a
non-exclusive right to archive author accepted manuscripts, and
provide the researcher with an extra layer of institutional support in
the (hopefully rare) case that a publisher raises a concern with
rights retention language in the manuscript.  Table X lists current
institutional policies; this list is expected to grow considerably
during 2023 and 2024.
