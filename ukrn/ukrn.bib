  abstract = "AIMS: Over the last two decades, the existence of an open access
              citation advantage (OACA)-increased citation of articles made
              available open access (OA)-has been the topic of much discussion.
              While there has been substantial research to address this
              question, findings have been contradictory and inconclusive. We
              conducted a systematic review to compare studies of citations to
              OA and non-OA articles. METHODS: A systematic search of 17
              databases attempted to capture all relevant studies authored
              since 2001. The protocol was registered in Open Science
              Framework. We included studies with a direct comparison between
              OA and non-OA items and reported article-level citation as an
              outcome. Both randomized and non-randomized studies were
              included. No limitations were placed on study design, language,
              or publication type. RESULTS: A total of 5,744 items were
              retrieved. Ultimately, 134 items were identified for inclusion.
              64 studies (47.8\%) confirmed the existence of OACA, while 37
              (27.6\%) found that it did not exist, 32 (23.9\%) found OACA only
              in subsets of their sample, and 1 study (0.8\%) was inconclusive.
              Studies with a focus on multiple disciplines were significantly
              positively associated with finding that OACA exists in subsets,
              and are less associated with finding that OACA did not exist. In
              the critical appraisal of the included studies, 3 were found to
              have an overall low risk of bias. Of these, one found that an
              OACA existed, one found that it did not, and one found that an
              OACA occurred in subsets. CONCLUSIONS: As seen through the large
              number of studies identified for this review, OACA is a topic of
              continuing interest. Quality and heterogeneity of the component
              studies pose challenges for generalization. The results suggest
              the need for reporting guidelines for bibliometrics studies.",

  abstract  = "Journal publishers don't need exclusive rights. Or, they don't
               need them for publishing. They don't need them to make a work
               public or to add value in the form of peer review, copy editing,
               metadata, formatting, discoverability, or preservation. Nor do
               they need them to make enough money to pay their bills and grow.
               Publishers only need exclusive rights for monopoly control over
               the published work and any revenue it might yield. Publishers
               who say they need exclusive rights are saying they need this
               monopoly control. The best evidence that journal publishers
               don't need exclusive rights is that so many peer-reviewed
               journals do without them, for example, open access journals
               using CC-BY.",
